    "\n",
    "More Data: One of the most effective ways to reduce overfitting is to increase the size of the training dataset. A larger dataset provides the model with a broader and more representative sample of the underlying patterns in the data, making it harder for the model to overfit.\n",

    "Feature Selection: Carefully select or engineer relevant features and eliminate irrelevant ones. Feature selection helps reduce the dimensionality of the data and can prevent the model from fitting noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
